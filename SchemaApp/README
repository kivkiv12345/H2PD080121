While I must admit that experimenting with generics and reflection has been an interesting endeavour,
it has also been increasingly frustrating, due to what I can only perceive as poor design of the C# language.
Questions such as: "Why can't interfaces have static members?" and "Why can't static classes inherit from each other?"
have been a constant during the development and have led to increasingly obtuse designs and constructions,
such as using abstract classes consisting of nothing but static members, as a workaround for inheriting static classes.
